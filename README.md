# windows-path-edit
CLI tool to modify windows PATH environment variable.
If you want to modify system variable (not user), you have to run the command prompt as administrator.

## Examples:
```pathedit append user d:\my-path```\
This will add the path to the environment variable

```pathedit get system```\
Just prints the system path variable
